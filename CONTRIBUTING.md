## Adding File Type Support

### Adding a New MIME Type or Extension

1. **Update extension mappings** in `lib/src/extension_grouping.dart`
2. **Add detection logic** if needed in `lib/src/file_type.dart`
3. **Write tests** in `test/file_type_test.dart`
4. **Add example usage** in appropriate example files
5. **Update documentation** in README.md

### Adding Magic Number Detection

To add byte signature detection for a file type:

1. Research the file format's magic number (byte signature)
2. The `mime` package handles most magic number detection
3. For special cases, update `FileType.fromBytes()` in `lib/src/file_type.dart`
4. Add test cases with sample files in `test/assets/`
